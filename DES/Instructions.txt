Use a pseudo-code to describe the DES encryption which takes 64-bit input/output. 
Define the subkeys for all rounds (a total of 768 bits) as input variables. 
You are given the following functions/blocks (you can just use these without implementing how they work, 
but define the other functions if you use others):

-- IP (the initial permutation, taking 64 bits of input and outputting 64 bits)

-- F (the round function, taking 32 bits of data and 48 bits of subkey and outputting 32 bits)

-- FP (the final permutation, taking 64 bits of input and outputting 64 bits)
