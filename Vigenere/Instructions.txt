This assignment is to build a pseudo-code for the Vigenere Cipher 
which takes English letters (26 alphabets) as inputs and outputs. 
Define the variables and use a pseudo-code to describe the encryption using Vigenere Cipher. 
The pseudo-code should support a key of arbitrary length, e.g., by having the key as an input variable.
Define all the variables that you use and clearly document the variables and each steps/lines of your pseudo-code, 
and be as brief as possible. 
Your assignment will be graded based on the correctness (does it work, e.g., did you miss any steps?) 
and presentations (e.g., is it easy to follow the variable definitions, logic, and the steps? 
Is the pseudo-code unnecessarily long?). 
As for presentation, you would want enough details/documentation, 
so that a person with introductory programming background (with any language) 
but no prior knowledge about Vigenere Cipher to be able to understand your logic.
